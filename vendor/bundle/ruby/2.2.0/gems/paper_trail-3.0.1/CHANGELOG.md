    with Rails `4.1.0.rc1`.

  - [#329](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/329) - Add `touch_with_version` method to `PaperTrail::Model::InstanceMethods`,
    to allow for generating a version `touch`ing a model.
  - [#328](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/328) / [#326](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/326) /
    [#307](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/307) - `Model.paper_trail_enabled_for_model?` and
    `model_instance.without_versioning` is now thread-safe.
  - [#316](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/316) - `user_for_paper_trail` should default to `current_user.try(:id)`
    instead of `current_user` (if `current_user` is defined).

    `ActionController::API` for compatibility with the [`rails-api`](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api) gem.
  - [#312](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/312) - Fix RSpec `with_versioning` class level helper method.
  - `model_instance.without_versioning` now yields the `model_instance`, enabling syntax like this:

  - [#289](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/289) - Use `ActiveSupport::Concern` for implementation of base functionality on
    `PaperTrail::Version` class. Increases flexibility and makes it easier to use custom version classes with multiple `ActiveRecord` connections.
  - [#288](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/288) - Change all scope declarations to class methods on the `PaperTrail::Version`
    class. Fixes usability when `PaperTrail::Version.abstract_class? == true`.

    [PostgreSQL's JSON Type](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/datatype-json.html) for storing `object` and `object_changes`.
  - [#281](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/281) - `Rails::Controller` helper will return `false` for the

  - [#207](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/207) - Versions for `'create'` events are now created with `create!` instead of 
    `create` so that an exception gets raised if it is appropriate to do so.

  - Renamed the default serializers from `PaperTrail::Serializers::Yaml` and `PaperTrail::Serializers::Json` to the capitalized forms,
    `PaperTrail::Serializers::YAML` and `PaperTrail::Serializers::JSON`.
  - Removed deprecated `set_whodunnit` method from Rails Controller scope.

## 2.7.2

  - [#228](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/228) - Refactored default `user_for_paper_trail` method implementation
    so that `current_user` only gets invoked if it is defined.
  - [#219](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/219) - Fixed issue where attributes stored with `nil` value might not get
    reified properly depending on the way the serializer worked.
  - [#213](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/213) - Added a `version_limit` option to the `PaperTrail::Config` options

    [#180](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/180)).
  - [#190](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/190) - Fixed compatibility with

    Controller metadata methods should only be evaluated when `paper_trail_enabled_for_controller == true`.
  - [#177](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/177)/[#178](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/178) -
    Factored out `version_key` into it's own method to prevent `ConnectionNotEstablished` error from getting thrown in
    instances where `has_paper_trail` is declared on class prior to ActiveRecord establishing a connection.

  - [#160](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/160) - Fixed failing tests and resolved out of date dependency issues.
  - [#157](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/157) - Refactored `class_attribute` names on the `ClassMethods` module
