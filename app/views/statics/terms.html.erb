    <b> Intellectual Property, Software and Content</b><br/>
    The intellectual property rights in all software and content (including photographic images) made available to you on or through this Website remains the property of Cryex24 or its licensors and are protected by copyright laws and treaties around the world. All such rights are reserved by UpCultured.com and its licensors. You may store, print and display the content supplied solely for your personal use. You are not permitted to publish, manipulate, distribute or otherwise reproduce, in any format, any of the content or copies of the content supplied to you or which appears on this Website nor may you use any such content in connection with any business or commercial enterprise.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Prices, Exchange Rates, and Confirmations</b><br/>
    Cryptocurrency and digital assets are highly experimental and risky. Cryex24’s conversion service attempts to provide accurate price and exchange rate information, but this information is highly volatile and can change quickly without users necessarily being aware of these changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    For standard orders (i.e., not “Specific Amount” orders), the exchange rate you receive is calculated at the time your payment is accepted. Due to varying security between blockchains, your payment is typically considered “received” at one block confirmation. Cryex24 may occasionally receive payment with zero confirmations, though this decision is at Cryex24’s sole discretion. It is important to note that an amount being broadcast to the blockchain network does not constitute acceptance by Cryex24 of that payment.
